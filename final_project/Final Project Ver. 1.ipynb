    "### Introduction\n",
    "Formula One (F1) is the highest level single seat car racing. Drivers compete in teams of two, with cars from manufacturers - Ferrari, McLaren, RedBull, Mercedes to name a few. The goal of each race is the be the first to cross the finish line after a certain number of laps. Each race is called a Grand Prix and there are a different number every year. Each track is different from the others and occurs in a different country. There are three parts to any race: practice, qualifying rounds, and the race itself. Practice lets drivers test their cars on the track. The Qualifying race has each driver complete laps by themselves to determine starting position. The race is the final and most important piece, where the drivers complete laps totaling up to a certain distance. Drivers are awarded points for both the position they finish in, and whether they set the fastest lap in a race. At the end of the season the points of each driver are totalled up to an overall rank. There are two main competitions in Formula 1: The constructors championshiop, where the team with the most total points is crouwned Constructors Champion, and the Driver's Championship, where the driver with most total points at the end of the season is crowned World Champion. \n",
    "\n",
    "Each country has their own F1 drivers. But what country has the best? Having the best atheletes is a point of pride for any country, but the statistics of individuals change every year, and can make it difficult to determine who has the best overall. And what makes a country have the best atheletes anyway? Is it having the fastest lap times? The higest rankings? \n",
    "\n",
    "We will analyze the lap speeds, number of wins, and overall ranking, to determine what country has the best drivers over all. (revise) \n",

However, this means that many drivers fail to place in the top 10 during a race and gain zero points. In fact, the nationalities of Malaysia, Indonesia, American-Italian, East German, Czech, Argentine-Italian, Uruguayan, have never seen a driver place in the points.
